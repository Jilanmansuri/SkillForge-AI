**SkillForge AI** is an AI-powered career growth platform that reads a user's resume or LinkedIn profile, finds missing skills for a target role, builds a personalized learning roadmap, and helps the user practice through an AI mock interview.

It is made for students, freshers, and job seekers who do not know **what to learn next**, **where they are lacking**, and **how to prepare smartly for interviews**.

## What is SkillForge AI?

Most onboarding and learning tools give generic advice.

**SkillForge AI** does something better:

It reads **YOUR** resume, finds **YOUR** exact skill gaps, builds **YOUR** personal roadmap, and then gives you an **AI mock interview based on the skills you are missing**.

### Simple Flow

**Upload Resume / Paste Text / Add LinkedIn URL → Select Target Role → Get Skill Analysis → View AI Roadmap → Practice Interview → Share Results**

---

## Problem Statement

Many students and early professionals want to move into roles like Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Full Stack Developer, Data Analyst, or AI Engineer, but they face common problems:

- They do not know which skills they already have
- They do not know which skills are missing for a target role
- They follow random YouTube tutorials without a proper order
- They prepare for interviews in a generic way
- They do not get a clear roadmap based on their own profile

Because of this, people waste time, feel confused, and stay stuck.

## Our Solution

**SkillForge AI** solves this by combining resume analysis, skill-gap detection, roadmap generation, and AI interview practice in one platform.

The system:

- extracts skills from a resume or LinkedIn profile
- compares them with role-based requirements
- calculates the skill match
- shows gaps visually
- generates a week-by-week roadmap
- explains why that roadmap was created
- creates mock interview questions based on missing skills
- gives instant feedback and scoring

This makes career preparation clear, personal, and actionable.

## Key Features

### 🧠 AI Skill Extraction
Automatically detects **50+ technical skills** from uploaded resume files (**PDF/DOCX**) or pasted text using AI. No manual skill entry needed.

### 🎯 Skill Gap Analysis + Radar Chart
Compares extracted skills against role-specific requirements. A visual radar chart helps users quickly understand strengths and weak areas.

### 🗺️ Adaptive Roadmap Timeline
Builds a **dependency-safe**, week-by-week roadmap grouped into:

- Basics
- Intermediate
- Advanced

The roadmap is personalized according to the user’s current profile and target role.

### 💡 AI Reasoning Trace
Explains **why** the roadmap was built in that order. Users can see the dependency logic instead of getting a black-box answer.

This is not generic practice — it is targeted interview preparation.

It also gives feedback and scores on:

- Technical Understanding
- Communication
- Confidence

### 🔗 LinkedIn URL Extractor
Users can paste a LinkedIn profile URL and the system extracts skills using AI. A fallback flow is also supported if direct extraction is limited.
